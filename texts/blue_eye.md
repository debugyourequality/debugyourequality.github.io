The blue-eyed island puzzle was proposed by Terrence Tao. 



The key of the puzzle is the domino effect of "knowing everyone knows". Why the foreign story teller can make a difference. The key is 'common knowledge' which is crutial in game theory setting that 'everyone knows that everyone knows it'. 

How is it related to social setting of sexual assult? 

- Discussing and/or broadcasting makes difference. 
- 
- The hazing number serves as a story teller. 
- Researches are late but we still need them. 

What I am proposing using this metaphor:
- Some claims are oversimplified, ego, hyperat, not falsifiable, not scientific, are actually true but at the state before the story teller. 
- Social norms are quite local. They all have the information but not actually rendered. 
- There's lag in the cascading of 'suicide' during which arbitrage can happen. 
- Abstraction of 'all know'
- A strong education on what's right or wrong, and acknowledge the time window, some 'bad' are bad, not your fault. 
- Suicide are story teller.
- Information and belief.



This is quite an analouge to 'cascading behavior' in network theory. 
Changes unless the other one change.
