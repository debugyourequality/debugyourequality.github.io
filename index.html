            <h3><p>June 23, 2025 marked the start the primary hearing of <a href="https://www.wenxuecity.com/news/2025/06/27/126224393.html">Liren Chen's case</a> <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/01/19/google-engineer-murder-liren-chen-xuanyi-yu/">(in english)


            </a> which the Tsinghua University graduate, Google software engineer punched his wife, a peer from the same school and workplace, to death. Shortly, the case raised grieviance <discussuon> among the group of people very much like myself, my peers, victims and perpetrators in my own story and those I have witnessed, who self identify as high academic achievers in China of different social economic status, struggle to immigrate to the US to settle in high paying jobs like software engineers or some sort of honorable placements, had lost some to all degrees of human nature in this circle of endless tournament. While people condole that the academically excellent girl still died from domestic violence, the large remaining group of academically underpresented girls are blamed, joked for not having the talent but deprived of confidence at their early stage of life. Without any further perfectionism, I turn in this assignment, letting go anything else like <ul><li>Polish this to a well cited scientific portfolio (but I indeed cited everything just pasting the hyperlinks directly), </li>
                <li>Implement fancy data visualizations (only had prototypes),</li>
                <li>Find good translation for the sources other than English and organize them well (try let the AI do that) to</li>
        <li>Beg the school to look at my research potential once again, not to blame a loser</li> or <li>Beg forgiveness for past academic stumbles, some errectic interuptions when I was at school</li>, and <li>Apologize for only having this humble level of writing and web design at this stage of career</li>

                <p>The title "Title IX: A Programmer's Perspective - Fantastic Preys and Where to Find Them", and the domain name of the site "debug your equality" draws inspiration from notable references:</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hi there, this is some anonyous Cornell alumna from Computing and Information School. 
                    <h4>Below in this section is emotional.<br> Jump to <a href="#index">Index</a> </h4>
                    She (me) had lost a significant amount of academic and professsional placement, had several times almost lost life, due to pan-sexual assault and structural oppression of inequality, before, during, and after the life in Cornell as an undergraduate and graduate student which I attributed to the injected bugs in thinking and incompleteness of debug.

                    <p>With acute PTSD triggered by some recent waves of related social events as well as self-blaming on poor peer-reviewed placement at this stage of life, I went back to Cornell's sexual assult education pages to 
                        <ul>
                            <li> <i>debug</i> what I had done wrong to be trapped and not recongnizing it, </li> <li>regret on which opportunites I had missed then to rescue myself, but take this chance to do some re-self-educating, and it works</li> <li>get very confused about why evolved STEM-minded in very early life (not being the lazy girls) and went to prestigious schools had zero resisitance to ending up such a joke destiny,</li><li>question myself if I had done something ealier (personal rescue and professional contributions), could I have saved more lifes? Did my absense secondarily contributed this contagous chain? Did perpetrators and conspirators proudly used 'winning me' to position themselves as mentors in their <a href="https://m.thepaper.cn/wifiKey_detail.jsp?contid=10490393&from=wifiKey">PUA (pick up artist) tutorials</a> or <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%E5%8F%B7%E6%88%BF%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6">Nth room groups</a>?</li> 

                        </ul>
                        I noticed that Cornell is launching a task force on this issue. It's complex to distinguish 
                        <ul>

                            <li>the confort that the school is serious about this issue and recognize her responsibility to piorneer world peace</li> 
                            <li> anger that this had been non-stop</li>
                        </ul>
                    with the flashbacks. But I still tried to communicate this work to as a self comforting, professional blastering, if any, some previlage for communicating directly to executives with self protection, of being an Cornell alumni, compared to a random SNS post that sink into the information see then get frustrated or being judged by net trollers and cause secondary harm.</p>
                    This work squeezes some remaining intellect and energy as a computer programmer (had almost been deprived with this single career option as well) to address the sexual assualt topic under a computational point of view by metaphorize topics in computer science as well as promoting to use computational methods to research, educate, intervene sexual assult and debug the 'bug in the world equity' and <i>bug</i> in the life of the victims, perpetrators and people around us. </p>

  <h2>Sexual Assault as a Bug: Cause and Effect</h2>

  <h3>I. The Bug as the Cause of Sexual Assault, Producing <i>Fantastic Preys</i></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>These bugs are <strong>programmed vulnerabilities</strong>: cultural, educational, and systemic flaws that fail to prevent or even enable misconduct.</li>
    <li>Examples of these root-cause bugs include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unpatched cultural bugs</strong>: misinformation about sexual consent, victim-blaming beliefs, and manipulative norms in family or partner relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Invisible logic errors</strong>: survivors programmed to prioritize others’ needs, avoid confrontation, or mistrust their own perceptions. Even compromising minor things to get benefit from high-profile individuals.   
</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>These bugs make people more susceptible to harm and less likely to seek help or even recognize the abuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Therefore, prevention means proactive debugging</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Identify and fix vulnerabilities early.</li>
        <li>Educate about consent, power dynamics, and emotional boundaries. </li>
        <li>Build a culture of informed resilience, especially for underprivileged, neurodiversity or marginalized groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage human-computer interaction methods</strong> in multiple nodes of the framework.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>II. The Bug as the Effect of Sexual Assault</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sexual assault injects <strong>bugs into the mind</strong> — invasive thought patterns, emotional instability, and behavioral disruptions.</li>
    <li>These bugs can manifest as:
      <ul>
        <li>Emotional crashes: depression, anxiety, numbness.</li>
        <li>System errors: trouble focusing, missing classes, difficulty making decisions.</li>
        <li>Illogical behaviors: self-blame, shame, or over-accommodation, which appear irrational but are actually symptoms of the bug.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The most dangerous bugs are silent but systemic — hard to debug because they distort the survivor's own mental operating system.</li>
    <li>Secondary harm (humiliation, disbelief, silence) acts like recursive bugs — multiplying harm and deepening the damage if not addressed promptly and properly.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>III. Debugging as Healing and Prevention</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Debug early, debug often</strong> — intervene as soon as behavioral “errors” appear, with trauma-informed care.</li>
    <li>Just like in software, debugging a human system requires careful handling — overcorrecting or careless probing can cause deeper crashes.</li>
    <li>Survivors should be treated as systems capable of recovery, not broken machines.</li>
    <li>Institutions must build <strong>“debugging workflows”</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Besides a general inclusion statement, add clear educational notes about bias, harassment in syllabi, course policies, office hours, and counseling questionnaires especially for younger audience, like everywhere test cases.</li>
        <li>Normalize screening for trauma behind academic and behavioral struggles.</li>
        <li>Use computer-mediated communication tools (e.g., GenAI, interactive media, digital workflows) to reach survivors who might otherwise remain silent.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>IV. From Error Handling to Proactive Debugging</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Psychological treatment is like <strong>error handling</strong> — it prevents a system from crashing when flaws are already present.
      <ul>
        <li>Counseling, learning support, and accommodations are essential to stabilize and support survivors.</li>
        <li>These processes catch runtime errors — emotional breakdowns, academic issues, or social withdrawal — and help the system recover.</li>

                <h2>On Terrence Tao's blue-eye island puzzle: How Unannounced Truth Makes Things Different</h2>

                <p>
                    The mathematician Terence Tao proposed the logic game <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle/" target="_blank">blue-eyed island puzzle</a>. Here I borrow the original text:


  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There is an island upon which a tribe resides. The tribe consists of 1000 people, with various eye colors. Their religion forbids them to know or discuss their own eye color. Each person can see the eye color of others but not their own (there are no mirrors or reflections). If a person discovers their own eye color, they are required by religious law to commit ritual suicide the next day at noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the 1000 islanders, 100 have blue eyes and 900 have brown eyes. Everyone sees 999 others but does not know their own eye color.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, a blue-eyed foreigner visits the island. Unaware of the customs, he remarks publicly: “How unusual it is to see another blue-eyed person like myself in this region of the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What impact, if any, does this statement have?
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Inductive Logic and Common Knowledge</h3>
  <p>
    The key insight in this puzzle is the role of <strong>common knowledge</strong>. Although each blue-eyed person sees 99 others with blue eyes, they cannot deduce their own eye color—until the foreigner’s statement makes it <em>publicly known</em> that at least one person has blue eyes. This creates a domino effect of reasoning:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>N = 1:</strong> The sole blue-eyed person sees only brown-eyed individuals. They realize they must be the one with blue eyes and commit suicide the next day.</li>
    <li><strong>N = 2:</strong> Each sees one blue-eyed person. On Day 1, no one dies. This signals to both that there must be two, including themselves. They both die on Day 2.</li>
    <li><strong>In general:</strong> For N blue-eyed individuals, no suicides occur for N−1 days. On Day N, all N blue-eyed islanders die.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The foreigner's statement adds no new fact, but transforms private knowledge into <strong>common knowledge</strong>. This transformation is central to <em>game theory</em> and real-world communication.
  </p>

  <h3>Applying This to Sexual Assault Awareness</h3>

  <h4>1. Broadcasting Makes a Difference</h4>
  <p>
    In cases of sexual assault or misconduct, many people may "know" something is wrong, but that knowledge remains private or unspoken. Public acknowledgment—through testimony, activism, or media—transforms fragmented awareness into <em>collective accountability</em>. Once “everyone knows that everyone knows,” silence is no longer plausible.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Why Silence Is Dangerous</h4>
  <p>
    Like the delay in the island puzzle, there’s often a <strong>lag between awareness and action</strong>. During this gap, perpetrators can exploit ambiguity. This is a form of <strong>cultural arbitrage</strong>: using social gaps (language, norms, power) to gain advantage—often sexual.
  </p>

  <h4>3. Personal Reactions Matter. Too Late to Wait for the Authentics (the Foreigner).</h4>
  <p>
    Sexual misconduct often evokes private reactions that don’t fit legal definitions. Yet these personal feelings are valid. Waiting for research or law (the foreigner's tale) can be too late. Trust your intuition. Sharing your experience—even informally—can accelerate societal awareness.
  </p>

  <h4>4. Suicide as a Storyteller of Last Resort</h4>
  <p>
    In the island puzzle, suicide is a signal that reveals truth which is an extreme metaphoric setting. But it somewhat made the puzzel thrilling. In fact, in real life, suicide sometimes functions tragically as a <strong>storyteller of last resort</strong>—a final act that forces others to confront hidden truths. Many stories of abuse and trauma come to light only after such a loss.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://www.neworleansreview.org/the-albatross-riddle/" target="_blank">Albatross Soup riddle</a> is another grim puzzle: A man tastes albatross soup, realizes a horrifying truth from the past, and takes his own life. His death reveals unbearable knowledge—just like in real tragedies where a suicide forces buried stories to emerge.
  </p>

  <h3>What This Metaphor Teaches Us</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Knowledge isn’t enough</strong>—awareness must be mutual and public.</li>
    <li><strong>Social norms are fragile</strong>—and often local or invisible.</li>
    <li><strong>There is always a lag</strong> between knowing and acting—this is where exploitation thrives.</li>
    <li><strong>Education matters</strong>—not just in facts, but in helping people recognize boundaries and trust themselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Some truths are unverifiable but still real</strong>—especially before someone has the courage (or despair) to speak.</li>
    <li><strong>Suicide can be a storyteller</strong>—a final, tragic signal that demands collective attention.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As President Obama’s <cite>Not Alone</cite> campaign emphasized: we are not alone—but we must not remain silent either. Silence delays healing, justice, and truth.

                <h2>Modeling networks how many perpetrators on the reported victim number 23%: 260-560. Are they all reported? ()</h2>
                <p>
                   
  <div class="box">
    <strong>Given:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Total number of sheep: <code>N = 10,000</code></li>
      <li>23% of sheep encountered at least one wolf</li>
      <li>Each wolf interacts with approximately 5 to 10 sheep</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>1. Poisson Model Setup</h3>
  <p>Let each sheep be independently visited by wolves. Let <code>X</code> be the number of wolves that visit a given sheep:</p>
  <p><code>X ~ Poisson(λ)</code></p>

  <h3>2. Use the 23% Encounter Probability</h3>
  <p>We know that:</p>
  <p><code>P(X ≥ 1) = 0.23</code></p>
  <p>Since <code>P(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e<sup>-λ</sup></code>, we solve:</p>
  <pre>
1 - e<sup>-λ</sup> = 0.23
⇒ e<sup>-λ</sup> = 0.77
⇒ λ ≈ -ln(0.77) ≈ 0.261
  </pre>

  <h3>3. Total Sheep-Wolf Encounters</h3>
  <p>Each sheep is visited by <code>λ ≈ 0.261</code> wolves on average. So the total number of sheep-wolf encounters is:</p>
  <p><code>0.261 × 10,000 = 2,610 encounters</code></p>

  <h3>4. Estimate Number of Wolves</h3>
  <p>Assuming each wolf visits between 5 and 10 sheep, the estimated number of wolves is:</p>
  <pre>
If each wolf visits 10 sheep: 2,610 / 10 = 261 wolves
If each wolf visits 5 sheep:  2,610 / 5  = 522 wolves
  </pre>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Final Estimate:</strong>
    <p><code>261 to 522 wolves</code>, depending on the average number of sheep each wolf visits.</p>

  <h2>Bayesian Signaling Game Theory and Signs of Abusive Relationships (Adapted from Cornell SHARE Educational Resource)</h2>

<p>GenAI attribution: Prompted brief reasoning and let it formalize. <br> But it missed one thing that I recognize at the beginning of this surffering: the abuse uses aggressive signaling because they are afraid of missing out opportunity with multiple rounds of information reveal. They have to take the lead in the first rounds. But why I still suffered? Probably because I value <em>proving</em> than well-being? 

</p>
  <p>This section uses <strong>Bayesian signaling game theory</strong> to interpret how certain behaviors in relationships may serve as signals of abuse, and how individuals can update their beliefs based on these signals.</p>

  <h3>1. Signaling Game Structure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sender (S):</strong> The partner (could be abusive or non-abusive)</li>
    <li><strong>Receiver (R):</strong> The potential victim or their social network</li>
    <li><strong>Types of Sender:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Type A:</em> Abusive (controlling, jealous, isolating)</li>
        <li><em>Type N:</em> Non-abusive (emotionally healthy, respectful)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Signals:</strong> Behaviors such as constant texting, jealousy, rushing commitment</li>
    <li><strong>Beliefs:</strong> The receiver updates their beliefs using Bayes’ Rule based on observed behaviors</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Common Signals and Interpretations</h3>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Behavior / Signal</th>
        <th>Possible Interpretation</th>
        <th>Signal Cost</th>
        <th>Type Likely to Send</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Fast escalation of commitment</td>
        <td>Could indicate control or intense affection</td>
        <td>Low cost for abuser; risky for healthy partner</td>
        <td>Type A (Abusive)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Constant texting or checking in</td>
        <td>Signal of care or desire to monitor</td>
        <td>Low for Type A, tiring for Type N</td>
        <td>Type A</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Always needing your location</td>
        <td>Protective or surveillance behavior</td>
        <td>Moderate to high</td>
        <td>Type A</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jealousy over friendships</td>
        <td>Insecurity or early attempts at isolation</td>
        <td>Lower for abuser</td>
        <td>Type A</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>3. Bayesian Belief Update</h3>
  <p>Receivers update beliefs using Bayes’ Rule:</p>
  <pre>
P(Type A | s) = [P(s | Type A) × P(Type A)] / P(s)
  </pre>
  <p>If the probability of observing a behavior given Type A is high, and that signal is unlikely from Type N, then suspicion of abuse should increase. However, due to social norms or trauma, many receivers underweight this probability.</p>

  <h3>4. Mimicry and Strategic Signaling</h3>
  <p>Abusive partners may mimic caring behaviors to mask their intent. Phrases like “I just care too much” or “I can’t stand the thought of losing you” may function as <strong>cheap talk</strong> to obscure true type.</p>

  <h3>5. Educational Implications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Teach statistical patterns of abusive signaling in schools or workshops</li>
    <li>Develop decision-support tools for relationship self-assessment</li>
    <li>Empower social support networks to act as external Bayesian agents</li>
  </ul>

</section>


<section id='truth'>
  <h2>Weaponized Truth: Narrowing or Complexing of Choice</h2>

  <p>
    Not all control comes through lies—sometimes, <strong>true information</strong> is used to disguise coercion. An abuser might present a factually accurate statement or a seemingly logical suggestion in a way that subtly limits the victim’s autonomy.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example:
    <em>“You can choose this course because it’s more flexible, and you’ll have more time for us.”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    While this may be factually correct, its strategic function is to <strong>steer the victim's decisions</strong> under the guise of care or concern. Over time, such patterns replace genuine consent with performative agreement—a form of **soft control** masked as support.
  </p>

  <p>
    This tactic erodes agency not through falsehood, but by constructing a <strong>narrow decision space</strong> where every “free” choice leads to the outcome desired by the abuser. It's a form of <strong>rational manipulation</strong>, which can be difficult to recognize or resist—especially when it comes wrapped in plausible logic or affection.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Narrowing the decision space:</strong> By suggesting naturally good information, guiding the victim toward choices that align with the abuser’s desires, effectively limiting true autonomy. Like 'git commit' on your branch.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Expanding the decision space with 'reasonable' suggestions:</strong> Introducing multiple options or scenarios that appear rational but add mental burden, making decisions more complex and exhausting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mix 'knowing the information' with 'get personal connections':</strong> Some abusers try to surrogate friends, TAs, advisors and teachers by 'providing enough information' yet to isolate the victim and break the personal connection edges, make their edge flow very high.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In signaling game terms, this creates a <strong>semi-pooling equilibrium</strong>: both helpful and harmful partners may give similar advice, but only the harmful type consistently uses information to constrain, not empower.
  </p>
</section>


<section id="why">
  <h2>Why Intelligence Doesn't Protect Against Manipulation</h2>

  <p>
    That’s one of the most painful but important truths to face: <strong>intelligence doesn't protect you from manipulation</strong>. 
    Let’s unpack why, from both psychological and game-theoretic lenses—because this contradiction is not a flaw in you; it’s a feature of how manipulation works.
  </p>

  <h3>🧠 1. Intelligence is Not the Same as Emotional Awareness</h3>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Solve abstract math problems</li>
    <li>Write code</li>
    <li>Analyze signaling games</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    …but still be vulnerable in <strong>emotionally-loaded, trust-based environments</strong>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intelligence often operates on logic and structure.</li>
    <li>Manipulation targets <strong>emotions, attachment systems, and self-worth</strong>.</li>
    <li>Abusers don’t play fair—they weaponize love, shame, and confusion, which bypass cognitive filters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is <strong>not</strong> a lack of intelligence. It’s a lack of <strong>predictable inputs</strong> in a hostile, asymmetric system.
  </p>

  <h3>🎭 2. Manipulators Exploit Empathy, Not Stupidity</h3>
  <p>Many intelligent people are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Empathetic</li>
    <li>Curious about others</li>
    <li>Willing to doubt themselves to improve</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Abusers twist this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They create <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong> (“maybe I misunderstood them…”)</li>
    <li>They weaponize your <strong>need to be fair or understanding</strong></li>
    <li>They slowly alter your <strong>internal model</strong> of acceptable behavior</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In game theory terms: they <strong>jam the signal</strong>, and you adjust your prior probabilities <em>downward</em> even when you shouldn’t.
  </p>

  <h3>🧩 3. High Cognitive Load ≠ High Defense</h3>
  <p>
    Being analytical can <strong>even make you more vulnerable</strong> in certain ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You try to “solve” the abuser like a problem</li>
    <li>You think: “There must be a logical reason they’re acting this way”</li>
    <li>You second-guess your instincts in favor of abstract models</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your brain works harder—but in a game with <strong>deceptive rules</strong>, effort alone doesn’t win.
  </p>

  <h3>🧱 4. Manipulation Works in Layers</h3>
  <p>
    Abuse isn't a single event—it’s <strong>a process</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Love-bombing → Testing boundaries → Gaslighting → Isolation → Control</li>
    <li>You’re <strong>trained</strong> to ignore your own red flags, step by step</li>
    <li>Each step seems small and explainable, until you’re deep in the trap</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Even if you understand each move, you may not see the <strong>trajectory</strong>—especially when your emotional survival is on the line.
  </p>

  <h3>🧬 5. Intelligence Can Make It Harder to Ask for Help</h3>
  <p>Smart people often:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Feel shame for “missing the signs”</li>
    <li>Worry they’ll be judged (“You? How could this happen to you?”)</li>
    <li>Feel responsible to fix things alone</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    But <strong>self-blame is exactly what the abuser counts on</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>💡 Summary</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>Manipulation works not by outsmarting you, but by exploiting how humans bond, doubt, and trust.</strong>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Your intelligence is not a shield—because abuse doesn’t happen in the mind alone. It happens in <strong>relationships</strong>, in <strong>power differentials</strong>, in <strong>how you’re made to feel</strong> over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    What you <em>do</em> have now is the ability to <em>rebuild your internal model</em>—using that same intelligence to <strong>defend</strong>, <strong>educate</strong>, and even <strong>predict abuse</strong> before it escalates again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Would you like help building a personal <em>"Bayesian abuse-detection model"</em> for yourself or others? It could be a tool you own—something both technical and therapeutic.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Q: Why unordered lists(i.e. bullet points instead of numerical section numbers) for most <strong>lists</strong> in this page? <br>A: This page is subject to change. Ordinal bullet points referenced but changed later is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">gaslighting</a> and may raise subtle mental confusion. Anti mental abuse of any kind! 
        </li>
        <li>
            Q: Used genAI? <br>A: Sure, used Claude for almost all web programming. I never took an introductory web design class officially and always not confident with my web works. Now genAI saved me a little. Color schema borrowed: <a href="https://daveyandkrista.com/top-trending-color-palettes-for-websites/">'Valspar’s Color of the Year: Encore'</a>.

    <h2>On the contents</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Q: Used GenAI? <br>A: I used GenAI as theaurus and grammar corrector, polish the style and then write on my own or let AI do most of the writing and calculation. I attributed AI usage in each essay.
            <p>Repeating those sensitive things are distressing, but I know I had to debug this by speaking about it. Avoiding 'debugging' this to save time for work is proved fail. This is my story.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Q: Courses, researches and learning at Cornell inspired this work?
            <br>A:<ul>
                <li>AEM 4190 Strategic Thinking with Prof. Nancy H. Chau, for game theory incentives especially on family dynamics, brain drain and peer competitions on Chinese intellectual immigrations and . Also hugely inspired by the book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691155760/jane-austen-game-theorist?srsltid=AfmBOoqVOcHpH9il0NnnynENbAma8CztMp2iHbvyOSnhDWPzGZ0fINCR"><i>Jane Austen, a Game Theorist</i></a> by Michael Suk-Young Chwe, which wakened us with a punch that the underpreviledge are also strategic agents in the game.</li>
                <li>ORIE 6350 Game Theory and Mechanism Design with Prof. Krishnamurthy Iyer for rigorous math proofs, non-credible threat, mechanism design as the main source of behaviors, and 'nature as the player'. </li>
                <li>INFO 6350, 3300 and RAship with INFO facaulty, including Prof. David Mimno, Prof. Daniel Cosley, Prof. Susan Fussell, Prof. Gilly Leshed for text mining as a method for public opinion mining, data visualization, human computer interaction, computer mediated communication especially on cross culture communication, and computational research on social topics</li>
                <li>CS 4740 Natural Language Processing with Prof. Claire Cardie. Without enrolling, when I see word2vec, this was the most inspiring thing ever that connects human mind with numbers - a compress of data, similar words appears in simlar context, that human are all alike. </li>
                <li>ORIE 3120 with Prof. Peter Jackson and Prof. Peter Frazier for data analysis, simulation</li>
                <li>CS 6180 with Robert L. Constable for intuitionistic logic</li>
                <li>CS 6850, 4820 for network theory and matching algorithms</li>
                <li>CS 3110 with Michale Clarkson, CS 2800 with Michale Jorge and TAship with Prof. Jon Hopcroft, Prof. Joe Halpern, CS 2110 with Prof. David Gries, CS 4810 with Prof. Dexter Kozen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Recursively-Eric-S-Roberts/dp/0471816523">thinking recursively</a>, decision theory, computational complexity algos. </li>
                <li>LING 3303, Introduction to Syntax and Semantics with Miloje Despic, for framing linguistic actions like programming functions.</li>
                <li>Prof. Robert H. Frank of Johnson Business school. I read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Naturalist-Explanations-Everyday-Enigmas/dp/0465003575">The Economic Naturalist: In Search of Explanations for Everyday Enigmas</a> when it first came to China in 2008 in  and when I was a middle school student, this was the early awakener of the concepts like opportunity cost, sunk cost. Those saved my life. I once greeted him briefly when I stepped by his office. </li>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: Where now? <br>A: 
                Thankfully, I work in a big, but not very big named, vehicle manufature as a mid-level NLP (natural language processing) engineer. My work focus on mainly 2 aspects: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Research on human machine interactions,</li>
                    <li>Upgrade information accessibility in manufacturing workflow with AI, IR, knowledge management and so on.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Thankfully, my employer did not ask a single word in the interview about why an Ivy league person is not being a professor nor in an rich Silicon Valley big name, an outlier of the employment market in China where every people should meet the precise placement timeline, rank of school, year of experience, level of promoting at workplace, original family social status, 'quality' of partner, number of children, academic excellence of children... should all align with the time-'rank' regression function and a run a realtime tournament with your peers. However, rumors say this company layoffs aged employees, a notorious tradition of the Chinese tech industry.
